#Basic idea to draw a line:
from x0 y0 to x1 y1:
	iterate from x0 to x1 and y0 to y1 with 0.01 as intervals and draw the pixel on every iteration.
	for(float i=0.; i<1; i+=0.01){
		int x = x0 + (x1-x0)*i;
		int y = y0 + (y1-y0)*i;
		image.set(x,y,color);
	}
	
	
#Optimising this shit:
	check if width is smaller than height , which means the line will be steep. So just transpose the line:
	swap x0 with y0 and x1 with y1
	
	check if x0 is > x1: if yes then swap the coordinates:
	swap x0 with x1 and y0 with y1
	
	dx = x1 - x0
	dy = y1 - y0
	
	float derror = abs(dy/float(dx))
	error = 0 // gives the distance to the best straight line from x,y.
	error +=derror;
	if error>0.5:
		y+=1 if y1>y0 else y-=1
		error -= 1
